            <p>Ravi Shastri didn't mince his words as he talked about the IPL 2023 star following his consistent outings in the season.</p>
            <p>A number of youngsters stepped up with consistent performances in the 2023 Indian Premier League, and Chennai Super Kings' Ruturaj Gaikwad is one of them. In 11 matches so far, the star youngster has scored 408 runs and is currently CSK's highest scorer in the season. Following his consistent performances for the side, as well as his impressive outings for Maharashtra in domestic cricket, Gaikwad was included in Team India's touring party for the World Test Championship final against Australia. The young opener is one of the back-up players in the squad.</p>
            <img src="./img/2.png">
            <p>Gaikwad had enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2021, when he ended as the Orange Cap winner; this year, however, Gaikwad has impressed with his strike rate, scoring at 147.29 (his highest strike rate in an IPL season so far). And former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes it shouldn't be surprising if Gaikwad is soon included in the Indian playing XI as well.</p>
